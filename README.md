Used: HTML, CSS, Python Flask, MYSQL    APIs used: Yelp, Google Maps

Introduction: The App provides recommendations to students on how they could spend their free time, based on their day-to-day timetable and location. 

The app uses a google maps API to find suitable places to eat according to the user's location. It also checks that if the user travelled to a given location, will they be able to return in time for the next class/task on their timetable, if that is the case then it shows that restaurant in red. It also orders the given recommendations according to their yelp rating.

The webapp is built on top of Python Flask. The front end is designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We are using MYSQL as the database.
